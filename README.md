# Capstone-Blockchain

# Blockchain Capstone Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a blockchain capstone project that combines various technologies and concepts in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The project focuses on creating a trading bot using MetaMask for secure transactions, integrating commonly used technical indicators with adjustable settings, implementing a user-friendly web GUI, and fetching real-time data of selected cryptocurrencies for informed trading decisions.

## Features

### 1. Trading Bot with MetaMask

The project incorporates MetaMask, a popular Ethereum wallet and gateway to blockchain applications. The trading bot leverages MetaMask's capabilities to facilitate secure and transparent transactions on the blockchain. Users can connect their MetaMask wallets to the trading bot to execute buy and sell orders seamlessly.

### 2. Commonly Used Indicator Integration

To assist traders in making informed decisions, the project includes commonly used technical indicators. These indicators are customizable, allowing users to adjust settings such as period lengths, smoothing factors, and other parameters to tailor their trading strategy. Some of the common indicators supported include Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands.

### 3. User-Friendly Web GUI

The project prioritizes user experience by providing a web-based graphical user interface (GUI). This interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to both novice and experienced traders. Users can easily access and control the trading bot, configure indicator settings, and monitor their portfolio through the GUI.

### 4. Real-Time Cryptocurrency Data

To make informed trading decisions, the trading bot fetches real-time data for selected cryptocurrencies. This data includes price charts, trading volumes, historical data, and other relevant information. The bot continuously updates this information to ensure traders have access to the latest market data.
